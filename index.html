    <h2>Hi! My name is Martin Rodriguez && I'm a Software Engineer.</h2>
    <p>I've been coding since 2019 but I first grew interest while pursuing a career in 
        Quality Assurance in 2018 at Year Up Greater Boston. One of my assignments consisted of
        creating a static blog using just HTML & CSS - it was there that I realized I wanted to 
        be on the creative side of Software Development and I started learning by using Codecademy and
        W3 Schools. Eventually I took a risk and attended General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive
        and shortly after landed my first contract role as a Front End Engineer!

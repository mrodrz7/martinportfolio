# Martin Rodriguez
Web Developer

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,html,css,git,github,md,linkedin,instagram,mysql,py,stackoverflow,twitter)](https://skillicons.dev)


This portfolio is going to be a foundation for Martin to build off of and allow him to both show hoff his skills as a developer and his ability to collaborate and effectively work on a codebase over time using html, css, javascript and git. 

The skills displayed here will allow him to showcase how much he will be able to contribute as a developer and team member. Martin is splitting his time between being a valued employee of his current employer, growing his skills as a developer and teaching me and others how to get started and excel in their own software engineering journies

Martin is personally responsible for getting me to where I am as a developer so I naturally jumped at the opportunity to assist him in creating and improving upon this repo for his personal portfolio. 

Not only is Martin a great developer and a great teacher, hes also an amazing person and friend. 

A company would do well to bring him on to their team!
